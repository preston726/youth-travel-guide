# youth-travel-guide
Personalized online travel guide generator for young people learning and growing through travel

I love traveling and learning about history, culture, and people through immersing myself in a new city or country. My wife and have made an effort to expose our children to the similar travel experiences. It is important to me that my children experience and learn while we are on vacation. I want them to have a broader, richer, well informed global perspective. Building personalized age-appropriate travel guide has been a great way of giving them that context. 

I have used different generative AI tools to automatically create these custom travel guides in a matte of minutes. For any vacation or trip with take. I am sharing that with her for others to iterate on and enhance. I welcome suggestions on how to improve this travel guide generator and make it more impactful and relevant for travel, learning or parenting.
